Note from Nathann:

Hello, this HTML Website was created over the Initio template from GetTemplate.
In order to run the Portfolio Site, I highly recommend loading "portfolio_home.html".
However, running the other .html files work just as fine too.

I've also opted to go for a Non-Hosted Website in order to showcase my knowledge in
programming, as I wasn't able to properly showcase it in the portfolio itself.

Now, the rest of this file will be dedicated to the original Read Me text file first left by
GetTemplate. Thank you for reading this note.
